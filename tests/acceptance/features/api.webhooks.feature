  Scenario: Image rebuild ready and reminder webhook deliveries are captured
    Given an archive with planner fixtures
    And collection "docs" has uploaded Glacier archive package
    And candidate "img_2026-04-20_01" is finalized
    And the client posts to "/v1/images/20260420T040001Z/copies" with id "20260420T040001Z-1" and location "Shelf A1"
    And the client posts to "/v1/images/20260420T040001Z/copies" with id "20260420T040001Z-2" and location "Shelf B1"
    And the client patches "/v1/images/20260420T040001Z/copies/20260420T040001Z-1" with state "lost"
    And the client patches "/v1/images/20260420T040001Z/copies/20260420T040001Z-2" with state "damaged"
    When the client posts to "/v1/recovery-sessions/rs-20260420T040001Z-rebuild-1/approve"
    And the client waits for captured webhook event "images.rebuild_ready"
    Then the captured webhook payload field "session_id" equals "rs-20260420T040001Z-rebuild-1"
    And the captured webhook payload field "type" equals "image_rebuild"
    And the captured webhook payload images contain only "20260420T040001Z"
    And the captured webhook payload integer field "reminder_count" equals 0
    When the API process restarts
    And the client waits for captured webhook event "images.rebuild_ready.reminder"
    Then the captured webhook payload field "session_id" equals "rs-20260420T040001Z-rebuild-1"
    And the captured webhook payload images contain only "20260420T040001Z"
    And the captured webhook payload integer field "reminder_count" equals 1

  Scenario: Image rebuild ready webhook retries after a transient sink failure
    Given an archive with planner fixtures
    And collection "docs" has uploaded Glacier archive package

    And the captured webhook sink fails event "images.rebuild_ready" with status 503 once
    When the client posts to "/v1/recovery-sessions/rs-20260420T040001Z-rebuild-1/approve"
    And the client waits for captured webhook attempt "images.rebuild_ready" result "failed"
    Then captured webhook event "images.rebuild_ready" has 0 successful deliveries
    And captured webhook event "images.rebuild_ready" has 1 attempts with result "failed"
    When the client waits for captured webhook event "images.rebuild_ready"

  Scenario: Persistent collection Glacier upload failure webhook is captured
    Given an archive with planner fixtures
    And the glacier upload fixture fails for collection "docs" with error "s3 timeout"
    When collection "docs" starts Glacier archiving
    And the client waits for collection "docs" glacier state "failed"
