Feature: Outbound operator webhooks
  Test harnesses capture outbound operator notifications so acceptance scenarios can
  assert emitted action-needed events and payload fields without adding product API surface.

  Scenario: Ready disc work webhook tells the operator to run arc-disc
    Given statechart "operator.notifications" state "ready_disc_work" is the accepted operator contract
    And ordinary blank-disc work is available
    When Riverhog emits an action-needed notification for ready disc work
    Then the captured webhook payload matches "contracts/operator/action-needed-notification.schema.json"
    And the captured webhook payload matches operator notification copy "push_burn_work_ready"
    And the captured webhook payload field "event" equals "images.ready"
    And the captured webhook payload field "title" is present
    And the captured webhook payload field "body" is present

  Scenario: Image rebuild ready and reminder webhook deliveries are captured
    Given statechart "operator.notifications" state "recovery_ready" is the accepted operator contract
    And an archive with planner fixtures
    And collection "docs" has uploaded Glacier archive package
    And candidate "img_2026-04-20_01" is finalized
    And the client posts to "/v1/images/20260420T040001Z/copies" with id "20260420T040001Z-1" and location "Shelf A1"
    And the client posts to "/v1/images/20260420T040001Z/copies" with id "20260420T040001Z-2" and location "Shelf B1"

    And the client patches "/v1/images/20260420T040001Z/copies/20260420T040001Z-2" with state "damaged"
    When the client posts to "/v1/recovery-sessions/rs-20260420T040001Z-rebuild-1/approve"
    And the client waits for captured webhook event "images.rebuild_ready"
    Then the captured webhook payload matches "contracts/operator/action-needed-notification.schema.json"
    And the captured webhook payload matches operator notification copy "push_recovery_ready"
    And the captured webhook payload field "session_id" equals "rs-20260420T040001Z-rebuild-1"
    And the captured webhook payload field "type" equals "image_rebuild"
    And the captured webhook payload images contain only "20260420T040001Z"
    And the captured webhook payload integer field "reminder_count" equals 0
    And the captured webhook payload field "title" is present
    And the captured webhook payload field "body" is present
    When the API process restarts
    And the client waits for captured webhook event "images.rebuild_ready.reminder"
    Then the captured webhook payload matches "contracts/operator/action-needed-notification.schema.json"
    And the captured webhook payload matches operator notification copy "push_recovery_ready"
    And the captured webhook payload field "session_id" equals "rs-20260420T040001Z-rebuild-1"

    And the captured webhook sink fails event "images.rebuild_ready" with status 503 once
    When the client posts to "/v1/recovery-sessions/rs-20260420T040001Z-rebuild-1/approve"
    And the client waits for captured webhook attempt "images.rebuild_ready" result "failed"
    Then captured webhook event "images.rebuild_ready" has 0 successful deliveries
    And captured webhook event "images.rebuild_ready" has 1 attempts with result "failed"
    When the client waits for captured webhook event "images.rebuild_ready"
    Then the captured webhook payload matches "contracts/operator/action-needed-notification.schema.json"
    And the captured webhook payload matches operator notification copy "push_recovery_ready"
    And the captured webhook payload field "session_id" equals "rs-20260420T040001Z-rebuild-1"

    Then captured webhook event "images.rebuild_ready" has 0 successful deliveries

  Scenario: Persistent cloud backup failure webhook tells the operator to run arc
    Given statechart "operator.notifications" state "cloud_backup_failed" is the accepted operator contract
    And collection "docs" has failed cloud backup after retries with error "s3 timeout"

  Scenario: Labeling does not create a standalone notification
    Given statechart "operator.notifications" state "no_labeling_notification" is the accepted operator contract
    And an unlabeled verified disc is waiting for label confirmation
    When Riverhog delivers due action-needed notifications
    Then no captured webhook event asks only for labeling
    And contracts/operator/copy.py defines no labeling notification copy

  Scenario: Routine success does not create an action-needed notification

    Then no captured webhook event is emitted for routine success
    And contracts/operator/copy.py defines no routine-success notification copy
