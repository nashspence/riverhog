Feature: Fetches API
  A fetch manifest is the recovery view of one exact pinned selector.

  Rule: Pinning a hot selector still yields a satisfied fetch manifest
    Background:
      Given collection "docs" exists and is fully hot

    Scenario: Pinning a hot selector returns a done fetch manifest
      When the client posts to "/v1/pin" with target "docs/"
      Then the response status is 200
      And pin is true
      And hot state is "ready"
      And missing_bytes is 0
      And a fetch id is returned
      And fetch state is "done"

  Rule: Pinning cold archived data creates a fetch
    Background:
      Given file "docs/tax/2022/invoice-123.pdf" is archived
      And file "docs/tax/2022/invoice-123.pdf" is not hot

    Scenario: Pin a cold archived file
      When the client posts to "/v1/pin" with target "docs/tax/2022/invoice-123.pdf"
      Then the response status is 200
      And pin is true
      And hot state is "waiting"
      And missing_bytes is greater than 0
      And a fetch id is returned
      And fetch state is "waiting_media"

    Scenario: Repeating the same pin reuses the active fetch
      Given fetch "fx-existing" already exists for target "docs/tax/2022/invoice-123.pdf"
      And fetch "fx-existing" is not done
      And fetch "fx-existing" is not failed
      When the client posts to "/v1/pin" with target "docs/tax/2022/invoice-123.pdf"
      Then the response status is 200
      And the returned fetch id is "fx-existing"

  Rule: Fetch manifests are stable and complete
    Background:
      Given fetch "fx-1" exists for target "docs/tax/2022/invoice-123.pdf"

    Scenario: Read a fetch summary
      When the client gets "/v1/fetches/fx-1"
      Then the response status is 200
      And the response contains "id", "target", "state", "files", "bytes", "entries_total", "entries_pending", "entries_partial", "entries_uploaded", "uploaded_bytes", "missing_bytes", "copies", and "upload_state_expires_at"

    Scenario: Read the manifest twice
      When the client gets "/v1/fetches/fx-1/manifest"
      And the client gets "/v1/fetches/fx-1/manifest" again
      Then the response status is 200 both times
      And both manifests contain the same entry ids
      And both manifests contain the same logical file set

    Scenario: Read a manifest entry upload view
      When the client gets "/v1/fetches/fx-1/manifest"
      Then the response status is 200
      And fetch manifest entry "e1" contains "recovery_bytes", "upload_state", "uploaded_bytes", and "upload_state_expires_at"

  Rule: Active fetches survive service restarts
    Scenario: Restarting the API preserves an active pin-scoped fetch
      Given archived target "docs/tax/2022/invoice-123.pdf" is pinned with fetch "fx-1"
      When the API process restarts
      And the client gets "/v1/pins"
      Then the response status is 200
      And "/v1/pins" entry for target "docs/tax/2022/invoice-123.pdf" contains fetch id "fx-1"
      And "/v1/pins" entry for target "docs/tax/2022/invoice-123.pdf" contains fetch state "waiting_media"
      When the client gets "/v1/fetches/fx-1/manifest"
      Then the response status is 200
      And fetch manifest entry "e1" contains "recovery_bytes", "upload_state", "uploaded_bytes", and "upload_state_expires_at"

  Rule: Split fetch manifests expose part-level recovery hints
    Background:
      Given split archived fetch "fx-1" exists for target "docs/tax/2022/invoice-123.pdf"

    Scenario: Read a split manifest
      When the client gets "/v1/fetches/fx-1/manifest"
      Then the response status is 200
      And fetch manifest entry "e1" lists split parts 0 and 1
      And fetch manifest entry "e1" part 0 is recoverable from copy "copy-docs-split-1"
      And fetch manifest entry "e1" part 1 is recoverable from copy "copy-docs-split-2"
      And fetch manifest entry "e1" part hashes and recovery-byte hashes match the published split fixture

  Rule: Fetch upload and completion are resumable and hash-verified
    Background:
      Given fetch "fx-1" exists with entry "e1"
      And entry "e1" expects sha256 "good-hash"

    Scenario: Creating or resuming an entry upload returns a resumable upload session
      When the client posts to "/v1/fetches/fx-1/entries/e1/upload"
      Then the response status is 200
      And the response contains "entry", "protocol", "upload_url", "offset", "length", "checksum_algorithm", and "expires_at"
      And the upload-session length matches fetch "fx-1" entry "e1" recovery bytes

    Scenario: Repeating upload-session creation reuses the same upload resource
      When the client posts to "/v1/fetches/fx-1/entries/e1/upload"
      And the client posts to "/v1/fetches/fx-1/entries/e1/upload" again
      Then the response status is 200 both times
      And both upload-session responses contain the same upload url

    Scenario: Completing before all required entries are present fails
      When the client posts to "/v1/fetches/fx-1/complete"
      Then the response status is 409
      And the error code is "invalid_state"

    Scenario: Completing a fully uploaded fetch materializes the target
      Given every required fetch entry for "fx-1" has been uploaded with the correct bytes
      When the client posts to "/v1/fetches/fx-1/complete"
      Then the response status is 200
      And fetch state is "done"
      And target "docs/tax/2022/invoice-123.pdf" is hot
      And target "docs/tax/2022/invoice-123.pdf" remains pinned
