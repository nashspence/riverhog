Feature: Recovery sessions API
  Glacier-backed recovery sessions track collection restores and image rebuilds from collection-native archive packages.

  Background:
    Given an archive with planner fixtures
    And collection "docs" has uploaded Glacier archive package

  @xfail_not_backed
  Scenario: Starting a collection restore creates a durable pending-approval session
    When the client posts to "/v1/collections/docs/restore-session"
    Then the response status is 200
    And the response recovery session type is "collection_restore"
    And the response recovery session id is "rs-docs-restore-1"
    And the response recovery session state is "pending_approval"
    And the response recovery session estimated cost is greater than 0
    And the response recovery session collections contain only "docs"
    And the response recovery session images are empty
    When the API process restarts
    And the client gets "/v1/collections/docs/restore-session"
    Then the response status is 200
    And the response recovery session id is "rs-docs-restore-1"
    And the response recovery session state is "pending_approval"

  @xfail_not_backed
  Scenario: Approving a collection restore verifies manifest and proof before completion
    Given the client posts to "/v1/collections/docs/restore-session"
    When the client posts to "/v1/recovery-sessions/rs-docs-restore-1/approve"
    Then the response status is 200
    And the response recovery session state is "restore_requested"
    When the client waits for recovery session "rs-docs-restore-1" state "ready"
    Then the response status is 200
    And the response recovery session type is "collection_restore"
    And the response recovery session collection "docs" glacier state is "uploaded"
    And the response recovery session collection "docs" archive manifest state is "uploaded"
    And the response recovery session collection "docs" OTS proof state is "uploaded"
    When the client posts to "/v1/recovery-sessions/rs-docs-restore-1/complete"
    Then the response status is 200
    And the response recovery session state is "completed"

  @xfail_not_backed
  Scenario: Losing the last protected copy creates an image rebuild session
    Given candidate "img_2026-04-20_01" is finalized
    And the client posts to "/v1/images/20260420T040001Z/copies" with id "20260420T040001Z-1" and location "Shelf A1"
    And the client posts to "/v1/images/20260420T040001Z/copies" with id "20260420T040001Z-2" and location "Shelf B1"
    When the client patches "/v1/images/20260420T040001Z/copies/20260420T040001Z-1" with state "lost"
    And the client patches "/v1/images/20260420T040001Z/copies/20260420T040001Z-2" with state "damaged"
    And the client gets "/v1/images/20260420T040001Z/rebuild-session"
    Then the response status is 200
    And the response recovery session type is "image_rebuild"
    And the response recovery session id is "rs-20260420T040001Z-rebuild-1"
    And the response recovery session state is "pending_approval"
    And the response recovery session collections include "docs"
    And the response recovery session images contain only "20260420T040001Z"

  @xfail_not_backed
  Scenario: Image rebuild stages a rebuilt ISO from restored collection archives
    Given candidate "img_2026-04-20_01" is finalized
    And image rebuild session "rs-20260420T040001Z-rebuild-1" exists for image "20260420T040001Z"
    When the client posts to "/v1/recovery-sessions/rs-20260420T040001Z-rebuild-1/approve"
    Then the response status is 200
    And the response recovery session state is "restore_requested"
    When the client waits for recovery session "rs-20260420T040001Z-rebuild-1" state "ready"
    Then the response status is 200
    And the response recovery session type is "image_rebuild"
    And the response recovery session image "20260420T040001Z" rebuild_state is "ready"
    When the client gets "/v1/recovery-sessions/rs-20260420T040001Z-rebuild-1/images/20260420T040001Z/iso"
    Then the response status is 200
    And the response body is binary ISO content
