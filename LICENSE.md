# Riverhog licensing

Riverhog uses a component-based licensing boundary.

The following server implementations are licensed under the Cryptographic Autonomy
License 1.0 (`CAL-1.0`):

- `riverhog/server/**`
- `companions/stove0/server/**`
- `reference/riverhog/storage/aws/**`
- `reference/riverhog/storage/backblaze/**`
- `reference/stove0/observers/exiftool/**`

Published OpenAPI and other explicitly identified interoperability artifacts beneath those
directories are licensed under Apache License 2.0 as recorded in `REUSE.toml`. Server
Dockerfiles, migrations, configuration schemas, deployment examples, and maintained
observer/target implementations remain CAL-licensed. No Riverhog file carries CAL's
Combined Work Exception unless it is explicitly identified there in the future.

All other first-party repository content is licensed under Apache License 2.0
(`Apache-2.0`) by default. This includes clients, reusable packages, utilities,
documentation, scripts, tests, archive-format and protocol specifications, API clients,
SDKs, interoperability examples, and independent recovery tooling.

`REUSE.toml` is the machine-readable authority for individual paths. Full license texts are
in `LICENSES/`. Third-party components retain their own licenses; see the
[third-party notices](THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md).
