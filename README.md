## Linting

Run the canonical lint flow with `make lint`.

That lane runs `ruff check .` and then runs strict `mypy` in a local locked `uv`
environment built from `requirements-test.txt` plus the editable project.

## Testing

For the fastest full check, run `make lint`, `make unit`, `make spec`, and
`make prod` in separate terminals. The lint, unit, and spec lanes run
locally in the same locked `uv` environment, and the prod-backed lane stays on
the checked-in Compose surface with per-run project names and ephemeral host
ports, plus project-scoped harness state and workspaces under `.compose/`.

Run the serial aggregate flow with `make test` when one command is more
convenient. That target runs lint first, then the unit, spec, and prod-backed
acceptance lanes.

Run `make ruff` or `make mypy` to execute those atomic quality gates directly.
Run `make build-app`, `make build-test`, or `make build` to refresh the local Docker images.
Run `make bootstrap-garage` to apply the checked-in Garage bucket and key bootstrap.
Run the production-backed harness against the executable acceptance contract with `make prod`.
Profile the production-backed harness with `make prod-profile`.
Run the fixture-backed spec harness lane with `make spec`.
Run the unit lane with `make unit`.
The `.feature` files under `tests/acceptance/features` are the source of truth for those scenarios.
