# Riverhog

Riverhog is a small, opinionated self-hosted archive service for me. I want to safely move files out of instant-access storage and onto optical containers. This api catalogs uploaded collections of files, automatically packs them into configured fixed-sized sets, and prepares on-demand ISOs for them. Collections that have not yet been burned, along with collections explicitly wanted active as well as backed-up, stay available on the filesystem under their original uploaded paths, while archived collections remain visible only in the catalog.

## Testing

Use the Docker-based test path as the default way to run tests. The test image has all necessary dependencies for testing. `docker-compose.test.yml` bind-mounts the live repo into `/workspace` so targeted runs always use current source files without requiring a rebuild for every code edit.

Run the full suite:

```bash
./scripts/run-tests-in-dind.sh
```

Run a targeted file:

```bash
./scripts/run-tests-in-dind.sh tests/test_ui_smoke.py
```

Run a single test or filtered subset:

```bash
./scripts/run-tests-in-dind.sh tests/test_ui_playwright.py -k collection_seal_and_flush_flow
```
