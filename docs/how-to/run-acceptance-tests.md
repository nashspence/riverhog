# Run Acceptance Tests

The executable acceptance contract lives in the Gherkin feature files under
`tests/acceptance/features`.

## Preferred commands

Run the last full check in separate terminals:

```bash
make lint
make unit
make spec
make prod
```

That keeps the local lanes and the prod-backed lane visible in parallel output
windows without changing the checked-in test surfaces.

If a canonical spec or prod lane is already running and you need to change
source, contracts, features, fixtures, or harness code, stop the lane first,
make the edit, then restart it. A canonical run is only valid for the checkout
that existed when the lane started.

```bash
make stop-spec
make stop-prod
```

`make stop-spec` sends a clean interrupt to any local spec harness process.
`make stop-prod` tears down in-flight prod-backed Compose projects. When you
started prod with an explicit shared project, export the same
`TEST_COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME` before stopping it.

Run the same acceptance contract inside the deterministic test container:

```bash
make prod
```

That path keeps the prod-backed `pytest` run in the canonical test container
while `docker compose` manages the checked-in `app` service and its storage
sidecars outside the container.

Do not run the production-backed harness with direct `pytest`. The supported
entrypoints are `make prod`, `make prod-profile`, or `make test`, which prepare
the compose-managed app and sidecars the harness expects.

Run the production-backed harness lane with built-in timing output for scenario and fixture hotspots:

```bash
make prod-profile
```

Run the fixture-backed spec harness lane against the same contract from a local
locked `uv` environment:

```bash
make spec
```

Run the unit lane by itself:

```bash
make unit
```

Forward pytest selectors or other pytest arguments with `args`.

```bash
make prod args='-k server_rejects_incorrect_recovered_bytes'
make spec args='-k server_rejects_incorrect_recovered_bytes'
```

Run the atomic image build targets when you need a fresh local app or test
image before the prod-backed lane:

```bash
make build-app
make build-test
```

Run the Garage bootstrap on its own when you want the checked-in buckets and
keys prepared without running the prod harness yet:

```bash
make bootstrap-garage
```

The non-production lanes resolve against the checked-in `requirements-test.txt`
set plus the editable project, so they do not require Docker or BuildKit. That
lock includes the `db` extra used by the prod-backed harness.

Run the serial aggregate target with `make test` when you want one supported
command to run lint, then unit, spec, and prod in order.

## CI opt-in optical-device validation

`make ci-opt-in-arc-disc` is an opt-in lane for real `arc-disc` optical I/O. It is
selected with `ci_opt_in and requires_optical_disc_drive and requires_human_operator` and is not part of `make test`,
`make spec`, or `make prod`, because it can require
operator-provided media, device permissions, and destructive writes to optical
media.

This lane validates the optical service boundary. The full workflow checks stand
up fixture-backed API, storage, session, and restore state inside the test
process; the real opt-in capability is the optical device. The lane fails if
any `ARC_DISC_*_FACTORY` override is configured.

Read-only mounted-media validation requires a mounted disc or mounted ISO
filesystem containing one known recovery payload object:

```bash
export ARC_DISC_CI_OPT_IN_MOUNT_PATH=/media/archive-disc
export ARC_DISC_CI_OPT_IN_PAYLOAD_PATH=disc/000001.bin
export ARC_DISC_CI_OPT_IN_EXPECTED_SHA256=<sha256-of-disc/000001.bin>
make ci-opt-in-arc-disc
```

Read-only raw-device validation uses `xorriso` to extract the same object from
an inserted optical disc. It can share the payload path and expected digest from
the mounted-media variables, or use raw-device-specific overrides:

```bash
export ARC_DISC_CI_OPT_IN_RAW_DEVICE=/dev/sr0
export ARC_DISC_CI_OPT_IN_RAW_PAYLOAD_PATH=disc/000001.bin
export ARC_DISC_CI_OPT_IN_RAW_EXPECTED_SHA256=<sha256-of-disc/000001.bin>
make ci-opt-in-arc-disc
```

Destructive burn validation is skipped unless the confirmation variable is set
exactly. Use blank writable media. The test generates a disposable ISO, verifies
it, burns it, then reads the ISO-sized byte range back from the same device and
compares it to the staged ISO.

```bash
export ARC_DISC_CI_OPT_IN_BURN_DEVICE=/dev/sr0
export ARC_DISC_CI_OPT_IN_BURN_COPY_ID=ci-opt-in-arc-disc-copy
export ARC_DISC_CI_OPT_IN_BURN_CONFIRM=write-optical-media
make ci-opt-in-arc-disc
```

Full CLI/API workflow validation is also part of `make ci-opt-in-arc-disc`. These
tests create the API state themselves, generate real ISO bytes from fixture image
roots, run `arc-disc` as a subprocess, burn one real disc, verify it by reading
the device, and then read that disc back through `arc-disc fetch`. The recovery
workflow similarly uses a fixture-backed rebuilt ISO endpoint and burns one real
replacement disc.

The full workflows use `ARC_DISC_CI_OPT_IN_BURN_DEVICE` for both writing and
reading and skip until the destructive confirmation is set. No `ARC_BASE_URL`,
fetch id, session id, staging directory, prompt input, or factory override is
needed.

```bash
export ARC_DISC_CI_OPT_IN_BURN_DEVICE=/dev/sr0
export ARC_DISC_CI_OPT_IN_BURN_CONFIRM=write-optical-media
make ci-opt-in-arc-disc args='-k full'
```

When a capability is not configured, the corresponding opt-in test skips with
the missing env var or device requirement. Once a capability is explicitly
configured, command failures are treated as validation failures so drive,
permission, media, and product regressions stay visible.

## CI opt-in Glacier-restore validation

`make ci-opt-in-glacier-restore` is an opt-in lane for live AWS S3 Glacier restore
behavior. It is selected with
`ci_opt_in and requires_aws_s3 and requires_glacier_restore`. The lane validates
the collection archive package path: archive tar, manifest, and OTS proof upload
to the configured AWS archive bucket/storage class, restore request,
restored-object polling, and package verification when AWS reports the objects
are readable. It is not part of `make test`, `make spec`, or `make prod`,
because it can issue real restore requests, depends on account permissions and
object storage class, and may take hours before restored objects are readable.

Restore validation requires the normal `ARC_GLACIER_*` archive backend
configuration and explicit restore confirmation:

```bash
export ARC_GLACIER_BACKEND=aws
export ARC_GLACIER_CI_OPT_IN_RESTORE_CONFIRM=request-glacier-restore
make ci-opt-in-glacier-restore
```

If AWS reports the uploaded archive package is not readable yet, the restore
request test still passes and the package verification test skips with a rerun
message. Rerun the same command after AWS completes the restore; no object path
or SHA override is required. If an older object at the stable opt-in key has the
wrong real S3 storage class, the lane fails with a remediation message instead
of treating an immediately readable object as a valid Glacier restore. Delete
the stale object or run with a fresh `ARC_GLACIER_PREFIX`, then rerun the same
command.

## CI opt-in Glacier-billing validation

`make ci-opt-in-glacier-billing` is an opt-in lane for live AWS Billing and Cost
Explorer behavior. It is selected with `ci_opt_in and requires_aws_billing` and
is not part of `make test`, `make spec`, or `make prod`, because it uses real AWS
account billing APIs, account-specific Cost Explorer state, optional billing
views, and optional CUR or Data Exports locations.

The lane requires AWS credentials with the billing permissions needed by the
configured account. It skips with explicit reasons when credentials or billing
capabilities are unavailable, and treats unexpected API errors as regressions.

```bash
export ARC_GLACIER_BILLING_CI_OPT_IN_CONFIRM=live-aws-billing
export ARC_GLACIER_BILLING_MODE=aws
make ci-opt-in-glacier-billing
```

To validate live CUR or Data Exports discovery and aggregation, also configure
the export location:

```bash
export ARC_GLACIER_BILLING_EXPORT_BUCKET=<billing-export-bucket>
export ARC_GLACIER_BILLING_EXPORT_PREFIX=<billing-export-prefix>
make ci-opt-in-glacier-billing args='-k export'
```

## CI opt-in OpenTimestamps validation

`make ci-opt-in-opentimestamps` is an opt-in lane for live OpenTimestamps
anchoring. It is selected with `ci_opt_in and requires_opentimestamps`. The lane
checks that `ots stamp` creates a non-fixture `.ots` proof and that the
configured verification command can verify the proof against the stamped
manifest.

```bash
make ci-opt-in-opentimestamps
```

The OpenTimestamps command must be able to reach its configured calendar service.
Missing commands skip the opt-in test; command failures after configuration are
validation failures. Age batchpass recovery payload encryption is deterministic
local command behavior and is covered by the normal prod-backed harness instead
of this opt-in lane.

## Compose-backed sidecars

The checked-in test scripts read `./.env.compose` when present, otherwise they fall
back to `./.env.compose.example`.

For prod-backed lanes, `make prod`, `make prod-profile`, and `make test` also
load the short recovery timing overrides
from `tests/harness/prod-harness.env`. That keeps the checked-in compose env
product-facing while still giving the acceptance harness the smaller timing
window it needs.

Each prod-backed `make ...` invocation uses its own Compose project name by
default so independent prod-backed runs do not tear down each other's one-off
containers, networks, or sidecars. The prod-backed entrypoints also publish the
API and WebDAV services on Docker-assigned ephemeral host ports because the
harness reaches them through the Compose network at `http://app:8000` and
`http://webdav:8080`. That keeps overlapping prod-backed runs independent of
whether host ports `8000` and `8080` are already occupied. Harness SQLite state
files, webhook captures, and acceptance workspaces live under
`/app/.compose/<compose-project>/` so the shared source bind mount does not make
concurrent prod-backed runs share catalog files or fixture trees.
Successful isolated prod-backed runs remove that generated project directory
after Compose teardown. Runs that explicitly set `TEST_COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME`
preserve the directory because they are intentionally reusing one stack. There
is no supported override for this state root; choose the Compose project name to
control isolation or reuse.

Older failed or pre-cleanup generated runs can leave stale
`.compose/archive-stack-test-*` roots behind. List the generated roots that the
maintenance command would delete with:

```bash
make prune-prod-state
```

Delete the listed generated roots with Docker-backed cleanup, which handles
root-owned files created through the source bind mount:

```bash
make prune-prod-state args='--force'
```

The command only selects generated `archive-stack-test-...-<pid>` roots.
Shared/manual state such as `.compose/acceptance` or explicit project names is
preserved by default.

If you need to reuse one Compose project explicitly, export
`TEST_COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME` before running `make`.
Do that before `make bootstrap-garage` or `make down` as well when you want
those standalone targets to act on the same compose-managed stack.

The prod-backed app image installs hashed runtime dependencies from
`requirements-runtime.txt` before source files are copied. The test image
installs hashed test dependencies from `requirements-test.txt`, then copies
`pyproject.toml`, `src/`, `contracts/`, and `tests/`. README edits,
documentation edits, source edits, and prod-harness state under `.compose/` do
not invalidate the dependency-install layers.

Regenerate the runtime lock with:

```bash
uv pip compile pyproject.toml --extra db --python-version 3.11 --generate-hashes -o requirements-runtime.txt
```

Regenerate the test lock with:

```bash
uv pip compile pyproject.toml --extra dev --extra planner --extra db --python-version 3.11 --generate-hashes -o requirements-test.txt
```

When dependency constraints change, regenerate both lockfiles in the same
change. Unit coverage verifies every locked package has `--hash=sha256:` entries
and that runtime packages shared with the test lock remain pinned to identical
versions.


## What lives where

- `tests/acceptance/features/` contains the normative external scenarios.
- `tests/harness/test_prod_harness.py` loads those features against the real production app and CLIs.
- `tests/harness/test_spec_harness.py` loads the same feature files against the fixture-backed spec harness.
- `contracts/disc/` holds the machine-readable ISO layout and YAML schema contracts that the acceptance scenarios verify directly.
- `tests/fixtures/bdd_steps.py` holds the shared step definitions used by both lanes.

## Readiness markers

- `@ci_opt_in` marks scenarios and tests that are excluded from the default
  prod-backed harness. Pair it with the appropriate `@requires_<capability>`
  marker for the real opt-in boundary and with a tracker marker such as
  `@issue_186` when it implies remaining work.
- `@todo` skips scenarios whose accepted contract exists before executable
  backing exists.
- `@contract_gap` means the fixture-backed spec harness executes the scenario,
  but the prod harness is still behind the contract. It is strict in the prod
  harness and ignored in the spec harness.
