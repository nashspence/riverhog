# Disc Format Reference

This document is normative for any ISO returned by `GET /v1/images/{image_id}/iso`.

## Commitment

- the disc planner must budget every byte that will land on the image: encrypted payloads, encrypted sidecars, encrypted collection manifests, encrypted OpenTimestamps proofs, the encrypted disc manifest, `README.md`, and ISO filesystem overhead
- `README.md` is the only plaintext leaf file on the disc
- every other leaf file is individually encrypted with `age-plugin-batchpass`
- on-disc filenames are generic; canonical collection paths live only inside decrypted YAML
- any collection represented on a disc, whether whole or partial, must also contribute its whole collection hash manifest and its `.ots` proof

## Canonical Root Layout

```text
README.md
DISC.yml.age
files/
  000001.age
  000001.yml.age
  000002.001.age
  000002.001.yml.age
collections/
  000001.yml.age
  000001.ots.age
```

Rules:

- `files/*.age` are encrypted payload objects
- `files/*.yml.age` are encrypted sidecar YAML files for the payload object with the same stem
- `collections/*.yml.age` decrypt to the collection hash manifest for one represented collection
- `collections/*.ots.age` decrypt to the OpenTimestamps proof for that collection hash manifest
- split files use `NNNNNN.PPP` stems, where `PP` is the 1-based part index on that image

## Disc Manifest

`DISC.yml.age` decrypts to minimalist YAML with schema `disc-manifest/v1`.

```yaml
schema: disc-manifest/v1
image:
  id: img_2026-04-20_01
  volume_id: ARC-IMG-20260420-01
collections:
  - id: docs
    manifest: collections/000001.yml.age
    proof: collections/000001.ots.age
    files:
      - path: /tax/2022/invoice-123.pdf
        bytes: 21
        sha256: ...
        object: files/000001.age
        sidecar: files/000001.yml.age
      - path: /raw/video.mov
        bytes: 7340032000
        sha256: ...
        parts:
          count: 3
          present:
            - index: 2
              object: files/000014.002.age
              sidecar: files/000014.002.yml.age
```

Rules:

- `collections[].id + files[].path` is the canonical logical path
- whole files use `object` plus `sidecar`
- split files use `parts.count` plus `parts.present[]`
- `parts.present[]` lists only the parts physically present on this image

## Per-File Sidecar

Each `files/*.yml.age` decrypts to minimalist YAML with schema `file-sidecar/v1`.

```yaml
schema: file-sidecar/v1
collection: docs
path: /tax/2022/invoice-123.pdf
bytes: 21
sha256: ...
mode: 420
mtime: 1713614400
uid: 1000
gid: 1000
part:
  index: 2
  count: 3
```

Rules:

- `part` is omitted for unsplit files
- the sidecar must contain enough metadata to restore the file without the API

## Collection Artifacts

For every represented collection:

- the disc must include the whole collection hash manifest, not only the files present on that image
- the disc must include the corresponding OpenTimestamps proof file
- both are encrypted like any other non-README disc object

This lets a person or tool verify reconstructed files against the collection-level manifest after recovery.

## `arc-disc` Expectations

Automated multipart recovery uses the fetch manifest as its recovery contract.

- the fetch manifest is the source of truth for automated recovery orchestration
- multipart logical files include part-level recovery hints in the fetch manifest
- `DISC.yml.age` is the durable media contract for manual recovery, validation, and offline
  inspection
- the sidecar says how to restore metadata and, for split files, how each object participates in the
  full plaintext

Expected multipart flow:

1. read the fetch manifest from the API
2. create or resume a user-specified local recovery state location for this fetch
3. determine which disc is needed next from the manifest's part-level recovery hints
4. prompt for successive disc insertions until every required part has been staged locally
5. read and decrypt the hinted payload object(s) and sidecar object(s) from each disc
6. concatenate plaintext parts in ascending `index` order when a logical file is split
7. verify the final plaintext against the expected `sha256`
8. upload one final plaintext file per logical file back to the API

## Manual Recovery

Without `arc-disc`, the intended recovery path is:

1. read `README.md`
2. decrypt `DISC.yml.age`
3. locate the desired collection id and file path
4. decrypt the referenced payload object and its sidecar
5. if the file is split, gather every disc whose `DISC.yml.age` lists that same collection id and file path, then concatenate decrypted plaintext parts in ascending `index` order
6. restore metadata from the sidecar and verify the resulting plaintext hash
7. decrypt the collection hash manifest and `.ots` proof to validate the reconstructed collection

If a collection spans multiple discs, the merge key is always `collection id + path`, never the generic on-disc object name.
