# Selector grammar

The same canonical projected-path selector syntax is used in API and CLI.

## Canonical syntax

```text
<projected-dir>/
<projected-file>
```

## Meaning

- `<projected-dir>/` targets every file whose projected hot path begins with that directory; it may span multiple
  collections
- `<projected-file>` targets exactly one projected file

## Normalization rules

1. Selectors operate over the projected hot namespace.
2. Selectors are relative to the projected hot root and must not begin with `/`.
3. Selector spelling is case-sensitive.
4. Directory selectors must end with `/`.
5. File selectors must not end with `/`.
6. Empty selectors are invalid.
7. `.` and `..` path segments are invalid.
8. Repeated `/` separators are rejected for MVP.
9. API and CLI preserve and echo canonical selectors in canonical form.
